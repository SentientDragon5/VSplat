# VSplat
A Vertex Color Splat map tool for Blender and Unity

This tool allows you to directly put triplanar mapped textures onto a material by correlating them to the vertex color. It's been done before, and you might have a better bet just using Polybrush and its vertSplat shader in unity, however I plan to edit this further specifically for my game. 

My primary workflow here is that I can model and design in blender, and vertex paint in blender, then just pop it into unity.

Here I use polybrush to paint the vertex color in the unity editor.
